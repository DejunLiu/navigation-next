 * This header contains a \c null_deleter implementation. This is an empty
 * function object that receives a pointer and does nothing with it.
 * Such empty deletion strategy may be convenient, for example, when
 * constructing <tt>shared_ptr</tt>s that point to some object that should not be
 * deleted (i.e. a variable on the stack or some global singleton, like <tt>std::cout</tt>).
