You need to increase version number by yourself. Here is the rule:

Build MAJOR.MINOR.SUB.BUILD

*	When feature branches are made (like for LTK) the SUB version should be incremented from the main branch number it branched from.

*	When feature branches are completed and integrated back to main, mainâ€™s MINOR should increment.

*	When release branches are made the branch version number should be set to the next main branch BUILD number, and the main branch BUILD number should increment by 50 or so to leave room for multiple builds.

*	The major number is meant to indicate backward compatibility.

Enjoy yourself.
